# hokey-pokey
Short tutorial script to command the robot to do the Hokey Pokey.


*Note:*

The code used in these tutorials is intended to run on the KIPR Link controller and written in 
the KISS Platform. You can find information about the KIPR Link and KISS Platform at 
http://www.kipr.org/hardware-software. The KISS Platform includes a simulator, so you can run 
the code on your computer without a robot. Our Botball team currently participates in the Junior 
Botball Challenge sponsored by KIPR. You can view more information for the challenge at
